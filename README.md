# ActionLearning Week
<h5>SMS & Exam Engine</h5>


Our model focuses on applications user-friendly, reliable, faster, andmore efficient. Our model will focus on making a web application toavoid any installation.Installationtasks make the usersuse a computer,but if we make a web application, we need only a browser to get theuserwhattheywant.

Our model precisely focuses on easy accessibility of the services whichare provided by the application and a smooth transaction between theuser and application. Since the educational industry is everywhere, wefocus on that. The most common methodologies used for schoolmanagement system is the management of everything whether itâ€™srelated to students, teachers including staff, and others to have propermanagementweneedtohandleeverythingpreciselyandinaneffectiveway.

The artifact for this project is a solution for the schools to reduce paper and files and make the task easier for staff and administrators, even the parents will be satisfied with this application because of the communication with teachers without meeting the teacher physically. In this application, we will ease staff-related modules. 

The staff should be registered to the system to access the other features of the staff-related module. In the staff module, we have staff attendance, staff salary, etc.

In our application, students must register to the system, so admissioncan be assigned to the registered student. By using the admissionnumber student can pay their school fees via the system, and an auto-generated rated receipt will be printed. 

Students can have MCQ online exams with the permission of administrators. In the application, the fees module is available. This is compatible with tuition fees and school fees. These fees can pay by the installment method.

This system can be logged in by any users who are registered in the system but it will tailored and privileged so that accessability will be differs. Based on each and every role type the, Dasboard will be customized.


* Final artifact will be a reusable prototype of the school managementsystem. 
* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Python Flask, jQuery, and sneat template has been used to develop the user interface of the school management system.
* Many microservices will be built and integrated with the Front-enddesign, as the services provide API which helps to bind with the Frontend.
* This artifact is developed considering the four mainactors of the school management system.

Multinomial naive bayes theorem is used for recommendation system for students. With previous data from the students used to train the model.
Nltklibrary is used from python for feedback system. Stop Words are removed so that the model is not trained on common words. The data from the students are stored in the database and reused in this case too to train the model to improve efficiency.
